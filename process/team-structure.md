Team Structure
====

Within every team there are some necessary roles that need to be filled. This goes for small teams as well as large; members of small just end up wearing multiple hats.

Roles within a team can change over time, so long as we avoid confusion by making it clear to everyone when something has changed.

Dev Lead
----

Duties include:

- guiding the technical decisions within the team. If there is ever any difference of opinions within the team about a certain tech to use, or a certain way of doing things, the dev lead has final say.
- primary point of contact with the client for technical matters.
- mentoring the other members of the team, making sure people are not only playing to their strengths, but also put in positions where they can learn and be engaged.
- able to get hands-on with coding whenever needed. Generally speaking, the smaller the team the more hands-on the dev lead will be.

Merge Masters
----

- senior developer able to do peer code reviews, and approve pull-requests / merges.
- see [Merge Master](./merge-master.md)


Project Metrics
----

At any point in the project we want to be able to see not only where we are, but also "how did we get here?". This role is responsible for things like:

- regular reporting on doc / test coverage, using tools to calculate coverage where possible, otherwise estimating.
- setting up key benchmarks that we can use to track performance over time.
