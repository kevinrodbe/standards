File Naming
====

To ensure consistent naming of files and directories across a project, set up [name-lint](https://www.npmjs.org/package/name-lint).

The recommended format is to use "lower-dash-case" for everything, but this is subject to change depending on the project.  See <https://github.com/joshwnj/name-lint/blob/master/examples/lower-dash-case.js> for an exmaple.
